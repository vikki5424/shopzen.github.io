üöÄ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (which includes npm)

MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)

1. Backend Setup
First, set up and run the backend server.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# Navigate to the backend folder
cd your-repo-name/ecommerce-backend

# Install NPM packages
npm install

# Create a .env file in the backend folder and add your variables
touch .env

Your .env file should contain the following:

MONGO_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
JWT_SECRET=<your_super_secret_jwt_key>

Replace <your_mongodb_connection_string> with your actual connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

Replace <your_super_secret_jwt_key> with a long, random, and secret string.

Now, start the server:

# Run the server
node server.js

# The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000

2. Frontend Setup
Next, set up and run the React frontend.

# Navigate to the frontend folder from the root directory
cd ../ecommerce-frontend

# Install NPM packages
npm install

# Start the React development server
npm start

# The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000

Your e-commerce website is now running locally!
